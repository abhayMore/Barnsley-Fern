# Barnsley-Fern

- Barnsley Fern is a Fractal created by Mathematician Michael Barnsley. <br/>
- It resembles a natural fern plant. <br/>
- It comes under the Iterated Function Systems (IFS). It works on four mathematical equations that are randomly selected every iteration, but that randomness has a
probability assoicated for certain equations, inshort having a weightage over another.
- The probability for the four equations goes as <br/>

>0.01% <br/> 
>0.85% <br/> 
>0.07% <br/>
