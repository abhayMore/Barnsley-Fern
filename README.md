# Barnsley-Fern

- Barnsley Fern is a Fractal created by Mathematician Michael Barnsley. <br/>
- It resembles a natural fern plant. <br/>
- It comes under the Iterated Function Systems (IFS). It works on four mathematical equations that are randomly selected every iteration, but that randomness has a
probability associated for certain equations, inshort having a weightage over another.
- The probability for the four equations goes as <br/>

>0.01% <br/> 
>0.85% <br/> 
>0.07% <br/> 
>0.07% <br/> 

#### FURTHER ADDITIONS 
- [ ] Reset/Draw again operation to generate the fern again.
- [ ] Change color gradiently.
- [ ] Variable change in equations' coefficient. (To have different shape of the fern)
- [ ] Add UI buttons.
	- [ ] Color Gradient Button. (Change back & forth from green to rainbow)
	- [ ] Add Stop/Start Button to stop iterations. (optional) 
	- [ ] Scrollbar wheel for the variable change in the eqns cooeficient.
		- [ ] Four scrollbar for 4 equations.
